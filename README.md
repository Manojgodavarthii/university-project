#**SAR Image Colorization using Deep Learning**


**üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview**      
        This project is focused on building an intelligent system that utilizes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery for accurate crop monitoring and classification. Unlike optical satellite data, SAR can capture information regardless of weather conditions or lighting, making it especially valuable for agricultural surveillance in monsoon-prone or cloud-covered regions. The system leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify various crop types based on their radar signal signatures. By pre-processing SAR data, extracting relevant features, and training predictive models, the application is able to analyze agricultural areas and identify crop types with high accuracy. The aim is to assist farmers, agronomists, and policy-makers in making informed decisions about crop health, yield forecasting, and land-use planning. By enabling early detection of crop patterns and changes, the project enhances food security and promotes sustainable agricultural practices. This project was developed as part of a college group initiative under the mentorship of ISRO, contributing to national-level goals in remote sensing and smart agriculture.To address this, we implemented a U-Net-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to generate colorized outputs from grayscale SAR images, enhancing visual clarity and usability. This project was conducted under the guidance of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation).

**Output:**
     This research demonstrates the successful application of deep learning, particularly a dual-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to colorize Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, transforming them from grayscale to more intuitive color representations. By integrating advanced image processing with an accessible user interface, we have improved the interpretability of SAR imagery, expanding its use in sectors like environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. Our results show significant improvements in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative assessments, with domain experts noting enhanced detail recognition and usability. Custom metrics for evaluating color accuracy for different terrain types further highlight the practical applications of this work.
    The methodology, which combined transfer learning, extensive data augmentation, and user feedback, successfully addressed challenges like the limited availability of labeled SAR data and speckle noise. The interactive GUI not only facilitated user engagement but also enabled continuous refinement of the model based on real-world feedback. This research proves that colorized SAR images can enhance decision-making processes by more accurately depicting land cover and improving image usability for various applications.
