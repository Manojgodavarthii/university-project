This project enhances SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery by colorizing grayscale images using a CNN trained in the Lab color space. It features a Tkinter-based GUI for real-time image processing, dataset selection, and output preview. The system boosts SAR image interpretability for remote sensing and geospatial analysis.
